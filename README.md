<img src="img/farnsworth.jpg"> Good news everyone, I've created an application that will fix data that's paths have exceeded the filepath limit. Behold the FilePathDelonger.

# FilePathDelonger
## Dependencies

This program uses Delimon.Win32.IO in order to read and move files that have exceeded Window's API MAX_PATH variable. Download Delimon.Win32.IO here https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/DelimonWin32IO-Library-V40-7ff6b16c

## Usage

Once compiled the program is simple to use.

1. Browse to the folder you want to fix
2. Browse to the folder you want the files to be output folders that exceed MAX_PATH
3. Click fix.
